Hello, so week two has been super busy. I'll talk about projects first.
I've started work on two mini projects which are both using data from 
the GAIA satillite. GAIA is a space telescope which is currently takening 
a cencus of all the stars in our galaxies the milkiway.(definitely 
watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGri4YNggoc&t=122s) 
on GAIA). GAIA is basically trying to find out all you need to know 
about each start (speed, brightness, distance, postions, 
chemical composition)
