*Paper title and abstract.*

Gaia DR2 astrometry has allowed the prediction of alignments of stars to such great precision that we can actually predict when a gravitational lensing event will happen. In some cases, these events provide unique opportunities to extract gravitational masses of the lens.

Gaia DR2 reignited interest in trying to predict these alignments and has led to ~ 5700 predicted events occurring over the next century by many different studies.
The question we investigate is - Can all these predictions be trusted?

Firstly,  it's worth mentioning that the vast majority of predictions by all studies with maximums far into the future are fine. We tried to get to the bottom of some puzzling characteristics of events that Gaia would hopefully observe! 

The story begins with the predicted event caused by the lens G123-61A. Here is a DSS2 image of the field around the event. You can see the lens (square) heading towards the background source (circle), and some unrelated DR2 sources (triangles).
