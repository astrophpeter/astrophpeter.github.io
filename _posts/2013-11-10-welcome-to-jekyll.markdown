description: My first week as a PhD Student
---

Hello! As this is my first blog post I should probably introduce myself, and
what I want to do with this blog.

I'm Peter, I've just started a PhD in Astronomy
at the Institute of Astronomy (IOA) at the University of Cambridge. Before that
I was at University College London where I studied Theoretical Physics. I grew
up in a tiny seaside town called Hornsea in East Yorkshire.

The main reason I'm setting up this blog is to try and highlight all the
interesting things that happen in astronomy, which often don't see the light of day
outside of academia. I also want to use it to explain what I get up to day to day
and what science I get done. Hopefully this blog should be to accessible
to anybody interested enough.

OK, down to busisness. I arrived at the IOA last
