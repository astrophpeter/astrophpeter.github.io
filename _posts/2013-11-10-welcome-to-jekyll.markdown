description: My first week as a PhD Student
---

Hello! As this is my first blog post I should probably introduce myself. I'm Peter,
I've just started a PhD in Astronomy at the Institute of Astronomy (IOA) at the
University of Cambridge. Before that I was a Student at University College London
where I studied Theoretical Physics.
