description: My first week as a PhD Student
---

Hello! As this is my first blog post I should probably introduce myself, and
what I want to do with this blog.

I'm Peter, I've just started a PhD in Astronomy
at the Institute of Astronomy (IOA) at the University of Cambridge. Before that
I was at University College London where I studied Theoretical Physics. I grew
up in a tiny seaside town called Hornsea in East Yorkshire.
