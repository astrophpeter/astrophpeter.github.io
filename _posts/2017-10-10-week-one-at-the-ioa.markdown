description: My first week as a PhD Student
---

Hello! As this is my first blog post I should probably introduce myself, and
what I want to do with this blog.

I'm Peter; I've just started a PhD in Astronomy
at the Institute of Astronomy (IOA) at the University of Cambridge. Before that
I was at University College London where I studied Theoretical Physics. I grew
up in a tiny seaside town called Hornsea in East Yorkshire.

The main reason I'm setting up this blog is to try and highlight all the
interesting things that happen in astronomy, which often don't see the light of day
outside of academia. I also want to use it to explain what I get up to day to day
and what science I get done. Hopefully this blog should be accessible
to anybody interested enough.

OK, down to business. So it has been the welcome / induction week at Cambridge,
both at my college (Darwin) and the IOA. This means I've attended loads of events
from night punting on the river cam to formal welcome dinners and drinks - all of
it has been pretty fun. I've also had the chance to meet lots of interesting people
at the Darbar (Darwin College's bar, which is open every night from 9. I'm still
not sure this a good thing as I live just above it, and my access to it is a little
too easy).

I've also been to various introduction talks at the IOA, and chatted to some
potential supervisors. Unlike most other departments in the UK, at the IOA students
aren't matched with a supervisor and project at the application stage. Instead we
get to 'shop around' and try out various projects and supervisors when we get here.
We don't even have to settle on anything until January. Currently I'm trying to
decide which projects to try out, anyway, more on that next time.
