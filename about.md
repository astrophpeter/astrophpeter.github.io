## About

I'm currently a PhD candidate at the
[Institute of Astronomy](http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of
Cambridge. I did my undegraduate masters in Theoretical Physics at University
College London. I've spent a couple of my summers working on the
[Galaxy Zoo](http://www.galaxyzoo.org) project at the University of Oxford.
