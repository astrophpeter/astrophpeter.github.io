### Research

I'm generally interesting in transient astronomy, where I get to work on 
time-series infernece problems. These are the topics im actively working on
at the moment. 


#### Real time transient host classification with blast



#### Predicting microlensing events



#### Near infrared microlensing in the VVV



#### Other
